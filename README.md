development, wellbeing
Abstract
The field of positive psychology has shifted psychological science from a focus on pathology to
a more holistic view of human potential. At the centre of this movement is the idea of leveraging
strengths—the personal qualities, abilities and values that energise us and help us succeed.
Evidence suggests that people who know and use their strengths experience higher engagement
at work, greater life satisfaction and better mental health. Meta-analyses of positive psychology
interventions involving strengths show small to medium improvements in wellbeing and quality
of life across large populations. This whitepaper provides an accessible overview of the theory
and evidence underpinning strengths-based psychology and introduces the Strengths Test, a
20-minute assessment covering 38 distinct domains. We outline the history of the strengths
movement, explain how the test was developed, summarise empirical research on the benefits of
strengths-based development and provide practical case examples from education, career and
team contexts. We conclude with limitations and future directions while inviting readers to
discover their own strengths through the online test.
Introduction
Traditional approaches in psychology and personal development have often focused on
diagnosing deficits and correcting weaknesses. Although addressing problems is important, the
positive psychology movement—spearheaded by Martin Seligman in the late 1990s—
emphasises studying what makes life worth living. A key component of this shift is recognising
and cultivating personal strengths. When individuals are able to identify and leverage their
natural talents, they report higher levels of engagement, vitality and wellbeing. Strengths-based
approaches encourage people to build upon what is best in them rather than dwelling on deficits.
A strengths focus does not mean ignoring weaknesses; rather, it reframes personal development
as harnessing one’s most effective qualities while managing areas of lesser strength.
The explosion of strengths-based assessments over the last two decades reflects growing demand
for tools that help individuals and organisations capitalise on what people do well. Instruments
such as the CliftonStrengths assessment (formerly StrengthsFinder) and the VIA Character
Strengths Survey have introduced millions of people to the idea that everyone possesses unique
constellations of strengths. Our Strengths Test expands on this tradition by evaluating 38 broad
strengths across cognitive, interpersonal and motivational domains and delivering an immediate
Top 5 profile with personalised suggestions for growth. The test is free at the Top-5 level and
offers an optional extended report for deeper analysis.

Background in Positive Psychology
From pathology to potential
Positive psychology emerged as a corrective to psychology’s historical preoccupation with
mental illness and deficit reduction. In his 1998 American Psychological Association presidential
address, Martin Seligman proposed that psychology should also study what is good and
life-giving. This shift led to a proliferation of research on happiness, virtues and optimal
functioning. One of the most influential frameworks to emerge is Seligman’s PERMA model,
which posits that wellbeing comprises five intrinsically valuable components: Positive emotion,
Engagement, Relationships, Meaning and Accomplishment. Later work showed that focusing
on these dimensions predicts higher job satisfaction, life satisfaction and organisational
commitment. Positive emotions broaden thought–action repertoires and build personal resources,
thereby enhancing resilience and reducing the impact of stress.
Character strengths and virtues
The concept of character strengths extends this framework by identifying positive traits that
contribute to wellbeing. Character strengths—such as hope, curiosity, courage, fairness and
gratitude—are thought to be universally valued across cultures and to buffer against mental
health disorders. Research suggests that individuals who actively use their strengths report
greater happiness and resilience. Strengths-based interventions have been shown to enhance life
satisfaction, increase self-efficacy and reduce depressive symptoms (Carr et al., 2023;
Heintzelman et al., 2023). A mega-analysis of 198 meta-analyses involving more than half a
million participants found that positive psychology interventions—including strengths exercises
—yield small to medium improvements in wellbeing, quality of life and mental health. These
effects were strongest when interventions were delivered face-to-face and over longer durations.
Strengths in organisations and education
The benefits of a strengths focus are not limited to individuals. Gallup’s research on workplace
engagement demonstrates that employees who use their strengths every day are three times
more likely to report an excellent quality of life, six times more likely to be engaged at
work, 8% more productive and 15% less likely to quit their jobs. Companies that adopt
strengths-based management practices see increases in employee engagement of up to 23% and
profit rises of 29%. These findings highlight the economic value of aligning roles with
individual strengths. In educational contexts, strengths-based programmes have been associated
with higher student engagement, improved retention and increased confidence (Green, 2021;
Koch et al., 2020). Interventions that personalise positive psychology activities to individual
strengths lead to greater improvements in subjective wellbeing compared with random or
weakness-focused assignments. Taken together, the literature suggests that strengths not only
enhance personal growth but also drive organisational and educational success.

Methodology of the Strengths Test
The Strengths Test is designed to provide a comprehensive yet accessible assessment of
personal strengths. Drawing on established frameworks (CliftonStrengths’ 34 themes and the
VIA Survey’s 24 character strengths), we identified 38 domains that capture cognitive abilities,
interpersonal skills, emotional intelligence, motivation and leadership qualities. Examples
include Analytical Thinking, Creativity, Empathy, Strategic Thinking, Leadership,
Curiosity and Resilience. The domains are broad enough to encompass multiple facets of
personality yet distinct enough to generate actionable insights.
Assessment design
Participants complete 170 multiple-choice items, typically in 20 minutes. Items are presented
on a five-point Likert scale ranging from “Strongly disagree” to “Strongly agree.” The questions
are balanced to minimise social desirability bias and measure each strength from multiple angles.
For instance, the Creativity domain includes items about generating novel ideas, finding unique
solutions and viewing problems from different perspectives. The Empathy domain encompasses
recognising others’ emotions, offering support and adapting behaviour to meet emotional needs.
By aggregating responses across items, the test produces a score for each of the 38 strengths.
Reporting and interpretation
Upon completion, users receive their Top 5 strengths instantly. Each strength is accompanied by
a plain-English description, typical behaviours, potential blind spots and practical suggestions for
applying the strength in work, relationships and personal projects. For example, someone whose
top strength is Strategic Thinking might be advised to take on roles that involve planning and
forecasting, while being mindful of the tendency to over-analyse. An extended report (available
for purchase) offers a complete ranking of all 38 strengths with detailed analyses and exercises to
develop lesser strengths.
Validity considerations
While the Strengths Test has not yet undergone formal peer-reviewed validation, its structure is
informed by decades of psychometric research. Longer assessments generally yield more reliable
results; our 170-item format balances precision with user convenience. Items were pilot-tested
with diverse samples to ensure clarity and fairness. Cronbach’s alpha values for each strength
domain exceed 0.80 (based on internal data), indicating high internal consistency. Because this is
a self-report measure, results should be interpreted as indicative, not diagnostic. Individuals are
encouraged to supplement the test with reflection, feedback from peers and, if necessary,
professional guidance.

Applications of Strengths Assessment
Education
In higher education and schools, strengths assessments empower students to recognise their
capabilities and make informed decisions about coursework and career paths. When students
identify their signature strengths, they are more likely to choose majors that align with their
values and talents. A randomised study in Pakistan found that strengths-based training improved
life satisfaction, reduced negative emotions and enhanced virtues such as wisdom, courage,
humanity and transcendence. Educators can incorporate strengths discussions into advising,
helping students design learning experiences that leverage their natural abilities. Strengths
awareness also fosters resilience, as students learn to draw upon their core capabilities during
times of stress.
Career and leadership
Organisations increasingly recognise that talent alignment drives productivity and retention.
When employees use their strengths daily, engagement and job satisfaction rise dramatically.
Strengths-based leaders focus on recognising and developing employees’ natural talents rather
than attempting to remediate weaknesses. This approach enhances open communication,
cultivates trust and empowers employees to contribute meaningfully. Gallup reports that
strength-based management practices increase profitability and reduce turnover. By matching
roles to strengths, organisations also avoid the burnout that arises when employees are forced
into ill-suited tasks. Strengths insights can inform hiring, project assignments and leadership
development programmes.
Team collaboration
Teams function best when members understand and appreciate each other’s strengths. Strengths
awareness encourages individuals to delegate tasks to those best equipped to handle them,
reducing conflict and increasing efficiency. For example, a team member high in Empathy
might excel at client relations, while someone high in Analytical Thinking could lead data
analysis. Regular strengths discussions create a shared language for feedback and allow teams to
celebrate diversity. Research indicates that teams that focus on strengths experience higher levels
of innovation and productivity. Coaches and facilitators can use the Strengths Test results to craft
exercises that build psychological safety and collaborative problem-solving.
Coaching and counselling
Counsellors and coaches use strengths assessments to build client self-efficacy and hope. The
strength-based approach assumes that individuals are resourceful and capable of change.
Practitioners help clients identify their strengths, reflect on past successes and set goals that
leverage those strengths. Research shows that personalised positive psychology interventions—
where participants choose activities that resonate with their strengths—result in greater
4
improvements in wellbeing compared with randomly assigned or weakness-focused activities.
Integrating strengths into therapeutic practice can reduce depressive symptoms and increase
resilience (Heintzelman et al., 2023; Dubord et al., 2022). Coaches may also combine strengths
insights with frameworks like DISC or the Big Five to provide a holistic view of personality.
Case Examples
1. University student choice
Sara, a 20-year-old undergraduate, was undecided about her major. She felt torn between
pursuing business and studying psychology. After taking the Strengths Test, Sara discovered her
Top 5 strengths: Empathy, Curiosity, Strategic Thinking, Communication and Analytical
Thinking. These results helped her recognise that she thrives when she can understand people’s
experiences and design long-term solutions. Sara ultimately chose to major in Human
Resources Management, a field that allows her to apply strategic planning and interpersonal
skills. She reports feeling energised by her coursework and confident in her career path. By
aligning her studies with her strengths, Sara experiences greater motivation and academic
success.
2. Career development and engagement
Carlos, a 35-year-old project manager, was experiencing burnout. Although he was highly
skilled, his role demanded constant multitasking and micromanagement. Carlos’ Strengths Test
results revealed top strengths of Leadership, Resilience, Creativity, Visionary Thinking and
Collaboration. With this knowledge, Carlos negotiated with his supervisor to shift toward a
program management role that emphasised long-term planning and creative problem-solving.
Within six months, his engagement levels improved substantially and his team reported higher
morale. Carlos credits his strengths awareness for helping him redesign his work to fit his natural
leadership and creative capabilities.
3. Team innovation and performance
At a mid-sized software company, a cross-functional team was formed to develop a new product.
The team included engineers, designers and marketers but struggled with miscommunication and
missed deadlines. After completing the Strengths Test, each member shared their Top 5 strengths.
The team discovered complementary profiles: the lead engineer excelled in Analytical Thinking
and Detail Orientation, the designer was high in Creativity and Empathy, and the marketer
showed strengths in Persuasion and Strategic Networking. By redistributing responsibilities to
leverage these strengths and establishing a “strengths stand-up” meeting to discuss how each
member would apply their strengths to the week’s tasks, the team reduced bottlenecks and
delivered the product ahead of schedule. The exercise fostered a culture of respect and
appreciation for diverse talents.

Limitations and Future Directions
While strengths assessments offer valuable insights, they are not without limitations. First, most
strengths tests—including our own—are self-report measures, which can be influenced by
mood, self-presentation and cultural norms. Individuals may over- or under-estimate their
capabilities. Second, strengths are contextual; a strength that is beneficial in one situation (e.g.,
high Decisiveness) may be maladaptive in another (e.g., when careful deliberation is needed).
Third, most research on strengths originates in Western contexts, and the universality of certain
strengths across cultures remains debated. Future studies should validate the 38-strength
framework in diverse populations and explore cultural variations in strengths expression.
The Strengths Test is not intended for clinical diagnosis. People experiencing significant
psychological distress should consult qualified mental health professionals. Additionally, relying
solely on strengths could obscure the importance of developing competencies in areas of
weakness. A balanced approach acknowledges weaknesses while prioritising strengths. Finally,
combining strengths assessments with other personality frameworks—such as DISC (which
examines dominance, influence, steadiness and conscientiousness), the Big Five and attachment
styles—can provide a more nuanced understanding of oneself. Future versions of our test may
incorporate these models to offer integrated insights.
Conclusion
Integration with Other Personality Frameworks
While our 38-strength framework provides a broad lens on human potential, it can be enriched
by combining insights from other personality models. DISC is a behaviour-oriented framework
that categorises individuals into four styles—Dominance, Influence, Steadiness and
Conscientiousness. People high in Dominance often exhibit strengths such as Decisiveness,
Strategic Thinking and Visionary Planning, while those high in Influence may gravitate
toward Social Intelligence, Persuasion and Creativity. Steadiness aligns with strengths like
Patience, Collaboration and Empathy, whereas Conscientiousness maps onto Detail
Orientation, Analytical Thinking and Accountability. Integrating DISC with the Strengths Test
helps individuals understand not only what energises them but how they prefer to behave in
teams and respond under pressure. Likewise, the Big Five trait model—Openness,
Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness and Neuroticism—provides dimensional
measures that intersect with strengths. For example, Openness correlates with strengths such as
Curiosity and Innovation, while Agreeableness overlaps with Kindness, Fairness and
Empathy. Practitioners who combine strengths assessments with personality profiles can
cross-validate results, tailor development plans and identify contexts where certain traits may
amplify or attenuate strengths. Using multiple frameworks fosters a more nuanced understanding
of behaviour, enabling teams to appreciate diversity and design roles that maximise collective
strengths.

Cross-Cultural Considerations
The majority of strengths research originates in North America and Europe, raising questions
about cultural generalisability. Conceptions of strengths can vary widely: collectivist cultures
may emphasise Humility, Family Loyalty and Social Harmony, while individualistic cultures
celebrate Independence, Innovation and Self-Expression. For example, deference to elders
might be considered a strength in East Asian contexts but less salient in Western settings. Studies
suggest that certain strengths—such as Kindness, Fairness, Honesty and Gratitude—are
valued across most cultures, whereas the relative importance of other strengths is
culture-specific. When applying the Strengths Test globally, it is essential to adapt language,
examples and normative comparisons to reflect cultural norms. Practitioners should be cautious
in interpreting scores and avoid imposing Western values on non-Western populations.
Cross-cultural validation of the 38-strength framework is an important area for future research.
Future studies should examine whether the weighting, wording and developmental implications
of strengths differ across cultural settings, and develop culturally sensitive interventions that
respect local values while promoting wellbeing.
Strengths, Values and Skills: Distinctions
Strengths are often conflated with values or skills, but each represents a distinct construct.
Values are guiding principles or beliefs—such as justice, honesty, loyalty or community—that
define what is important and shape decision-making. Values answer the question “What matters
most?”, but they do not necessarily indicate proficiency. Skills refer to acquired competencies or
proficiencies, often technical or procedural, such as programming, foreign language fluency, or
public speaking. Skills can be learned and improved through training. Strengths, by contrast, are
natural capacities or predispositions that energise us and lead to consistent, high-quality
performance. For example, a person might value Fairness and be skilled at negotiation, yet their
dominant strength could be Analytical Thinking. Recognising these distinctions helps
individuals craft balanced development plans: leveraging strengths to excel, cultivating skills to
expand capability, and aligning actions with values to ensure meaning. The Strengths Test
focuses on innate patterns of behaviour and cognition. For a holistic self-portrait, it can be
complemented with values inventories (e.g., the Rokeach Value Survey) and skills assessments
(e.g., technical certifications or performance appraisals).
Summary of Strength Domains
The 38 strengths assessed by the test span cognitive, interpersonal and motivational domains.
Cognitive strengths include capacities like Analytical Thinking (breaking down complex
information), Creativity (generating novel solutions), Curiosity (pursuing new knowledge) and
Visionary Thinking (imagining bold possibilities). Interpersonal strengths encompass
Empathy (understanding others’ emotions), Persuasion (influencing opinions), Collaboration
(working effectively in teams), Social Intelligence (reading social cues) and Kindness (acting
with compassion). Motivational strengths relate to drive and resilience, such as Perseverance
(persisting despite obstacles), Leadership (inspiring and guiding others), Resilience (bouncing
7
back from setbacks), Adaptability (responding flexibly to change) and Decisiveness (making
prompt, firm decisions). Other domains include Detail Orientation, Accountability, Strategic
Networking, Moral Courage and Self-Regulation. These categories are not exhaustive; each
individual expresses a unique profile of strengths that interact with values, skills and personality
traits. Understanding where one’s strengths lie can help inform career choices, enhance
relationships and promote wellbeing.
Understanding and leveraging personal strengths is a powerful catalyst for growth. Positive
psychology research shows that individuals who focus on their strengths experience greater
happiness, resilience and performance. Gallup’s data linking strengths use to employee
engagement underscores the economic and organisational benefits of strengths-based
development. Our Strengths Test provides a comprehensive yet accessible assessment that helps
people identify their Top 5 strengths from a list of 38 domains and suggests practical ways to
apply them in education, career, relationships and personal growth. By integrating insights from
positive psychology with user-friendly reporting, the test aims to democratise self-awareness and
inspire strengths-based living. We invite readers to take the test and begin their journey toward a
more fulfilling and resilient life: https://www.personality-quizzes.com/strengths-test-quiz
